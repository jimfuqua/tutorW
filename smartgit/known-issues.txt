Known Issues with SmartGit
==========================
Linux
-----
* SmartGit must be started using bin/smartgit.sh. To install a menu item
  or a launcher link use bin/add-menuitem.sh. Don't just try to pin the 
  launched SmartGit instance to the Unity launcher, because clicking this
  will not launch the script and might cause hard crashes, e.g. because of
  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=419729
  that require certain environment variables be set.

* KDE desktop with oxygen-gtk theme crashes when a combobox needs to be shown:

Mac OS X
--------
* When the toolbar is hidden and the full-screen option is toggled, it can
  become visible again, but remains empty:

Windows
-------
* The toolbar may lose the font, e.g. by logging in using a different user.
