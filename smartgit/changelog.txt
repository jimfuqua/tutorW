SmartGit 7.1 preview 12 (2016-01-21)
====================================
New Features, Improvements

    - only available in commercial edition

  - VM option "smartgit.svn.defaultCommitMessage" to customize, e.g. tag
    creation message

  - only multiple refs are truncated, not single refs
- Updater:
  - VM option "smartgit.updater.directory" to customize updater's working
    directory (e.g. if launching executables is not allowed in all directories)

Fixed Bugs
