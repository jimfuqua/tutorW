Problem is that getCurrentStudentAssignmentsInAnArray
is not returning lessons_array
problems
  Lessons do not contain a tA_Post_date
  Probably should use  UTC_TIMESTAMP( )  instead of UNIX_TIMESTAMP()
   I have changed to UTC_TIMESTAMP() but not test_lesson_include
   Name should be in quotes.  Put them in but have not tested

  test_clockwise is not inserting the tA_Post_date
***********
use phpcs on all lessons after counterclockwise
get pdepends data
use eslint on all lesson js
