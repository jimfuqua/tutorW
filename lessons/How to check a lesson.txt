HOW TO CHECK A LESSON

1.  Eliminate all php errors.
2.  Eliminate all js errors.

3.  Check data in tCompleted.
        Was tC_Question_and_Response responsive?
            It does not need a "Response" if there are only two options.
            because tC_Correct discloses the response.
            On math problems should have both.
        tC_CompletedTimestamp have data?
        tC_ServerTimeStarted have data?
        tC_ClientTimeStarted have data?
        tC_Time_client_processed_answer have data?

        tA_ErrorsMade correct on error with tA_RepsTowardM set to zero 0?
        tA_LocalDateTime
        tA_Post_date
